* Up Next
Wrestlers to watch list (starred wrestlers)
Sort schedule within a day by "best matches" (sum of ranks asc?)
Auto-update rankings
Attempt some schedule scraping. Or at least list teams to manually scrape

* Maybe
- Only show top ten matchups for two weeks out
- logos for networks
- logos for teams
- add matches to Google Calendar? (would need times...)
- track rankings over time?  (rankings with date table instead of on wrestler?)

X - Highlight top 10 matchups
X - Team rankings page.
